    The dark broth of this ramen is very salty and very tasty.
    On top of the noodles is grilled pork, crispy nori and a yolky egg. 
    The inside of the shop is tiny, only able to seat 8 at a time, and usually filled with 
    salary men and hip hop music. Experience the nightlife of Shibuya and acknowledge 
    that you cannot knock Jay Z's hustle.

  description: |
    One of the most famous ramen shops in Shibuya, Hayashi Ramen is open Monday to Saturday from 11:30 to 15:30.
    The menu reflects the attitudes of the shop owners, simple and to the point. Only 3 items: Ramen, Ajitama Ramen (soft boiled egg), and Yakibuta Ramen (extra roast, pork char siu). I opted for the Yakibuta Ramen.
    The shop has many rules, and the shop owner will militantly enforce them. The rules include not taking too long to finish your bowl,
    not taking pictures of the inside of the shop, and many more than you will be scolded for in Japanese if you break them.
    Now to the ramen. The soup is milky and combines pork and fish flavors. The noodles are thin, flat, and cooked al dente so it gave a nice bite when you chewed through them.
    Overall, it lives of to its fame, and it is no wonder why this is one of the most famous shops in Shibuya.

    One of the oldest ramen shops in Tokyo, this shop opened in 1952 and has since remained
    somewhat of a relic amongst the bustling metropolis nearby. Many of the customers
    have been coming here for decades and some of the staff appear to have
    been around even longer. Saddle up for some old school Tokyo-style Shoyu
    ramen with chewy house-made noodles and dried onions. Order 'moyashi' if
    you want your bowl to be piled with bean sprouts. Wontonmen is also available.
    Nothing fake or touristy here, just old school Japanese soul food. Beloved and
    legendary shop.

    bean sprouts. In my experience, there is often a queue that is a 20 to 30 minute wait.
    When they will ask you your preference of vegetables and garlic, simply
    respond with ましお願いします (mashi onegaishimasu) and the ramen master will hook you up
    with the largest bowl of ramen you have ever seen.

  style: Tsukemen
  description: |
    Located in Shinjuku, Fūunji has been a very popular ramen shop since its inception in 2007.
    I was hesitant to add this shop to the list, but ended up deciding it did belong here.
    First off, the prices are relatively high compared to other bowls on this list. The special tsukemen
    is 1000 yen, and the regular tsukemen is 800 yen. Although extra noodles are free (Oomori desu), it is clear
    that the Shinjuku rent prices are reflected in the menu. Additionally, and admittedly it is a small gripe, 
    customers in line are forced to stand behind customers sitting down already eating. This makes for a less
    comfortable eating experience. It is not that pleasant to have people standing behind you staring at your food while you're eating.
    As for the tsukemen, it was excellent. The master at this shop is extremely skilled and you will enjoy watching him prepare the noodles and run the shop while you wait.
    The noodles are round with a wavy shape. The broth is extremely thick with bits of meat throughout and of course massive chunks of pork and a soft boiled egg inside.
    However, when I received my broth it was already lukewarm. By the time I finished my bowl, it was all but cold.
    Overall great tsukemen, but bceause of what was previously mentioned I had a few disappointments.

    My #1 go-to ramen shop. Very good Hakata ramen, one of the best and most authentic I have
    tried in Tokyo. Located near Futako Tamagawa Station. 
    The shop is a little dirty, and inside there are only 8 seats, so sometimes you might
    have to wait in a short line. The broth is made from proper pork bones. 
    On multiple occasions I have seen an employee dumping bags of pork bones
    into the broth vat in the back of the shop, so you know it's legit. I recommend ordering a half
    bowl of rice after you finish your noodles, then putting the rice with
    the all you can eat takana (Japanese giant red mustard) into the remaining 
    broth and enjoy.

    Literally called mammoth ramen, this ramen was inspired by Jiro ramen.
    It is only open during lunchtime from 11AM - 3PM and there is usually a line.
    The combination of pork and seafood is exquisite. When your bowl is delivered the
    bonito flakes are still dancing on top of the thick cuts of pork. For only
    ¥800, the basic bowl is still a massive portion size. You can choose regular or spicy.
    I also recommend asking for extra garlic (nin niku).

    and Hakata ramen, Kitakata ramen is one of Japan's three major ramen noodle dynasties. 
    Kitakata ramen is characterized by its unique noodles, known as Hirauchi Jukusei Taka Suimen, 
    which translates as “Matured Flat Noodles with Lots of Water,” they are about four millimeters wide, 
    flat and curled. Because they’ve been matured for a long period of time, they’re firm, filling, 
    and have a unique texture when chewed. The line during lunch was about 1.5 hours, but it was worth it
    to try this legendary ramen shop.

    A unique style found in the northern most part of Honshu, this shops serves up

    from Sapporo to the north, the legend goes that several years after it initially 
    opening in the 1970s, some high schoolers would add ketchup and mayonnaise to make
    their ramen more filling. This prompted the shop to create a miso, curry and milk
    combination. The soup is surprisingly mild. The thick, curly egg-yellow noodles, made 
    locally, provide a more chewier texture. Topped with chashu, bean sprouts, bamboo
    shoots and seaweed, this  is extremely delicious and satisfying.
