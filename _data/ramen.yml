    Located in the heart of Shibuya, if you come here past midnight you might encounter
    some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shibuyameltdown/?hl=de">Shibuya Metldown</a>.
    The dark broth of this ramen is very salty and very tasty.
    On top of the noodles is grilled pork, crispy nori and a yolky egg. 
    The inside of the shop is tiny, only able to seat 8 at a time, and usually filled with 
    salary men and hip hop music. Experience the nightlife of Shibuya and ackowledge 
    that you cannot knock Jay Z's hustle.

    If you are in search of oily, fatty jiro ramen that will make your gut burst, look no further.
    Starting at ¥700, the ramen bowls here are topped with thick cuts of pork,
    a boiled egg, a generous plop of garlic and a massive heap of 
    bean sprouts. In my experience, there is often a queue that is a 20 to 30 minute wait.
    When they will ask you your preference of vegetables and garlic, simply
    respond with ましお願いします (mashi onegaishimasu) and the ramen master will hook you up
    with the largest bowl of ramen you have ever seen.

    While technically not ramen, I could not exclude this mazesoba shop from the list.
    A tapestry of seaweed flakes, green onions, chives, minced garlic, 
    nori (dried seaweed), chashu (pork), spicy minced pork, raw egg yolk, 
    and a soft-boiled egg mixed together to create a brothless noodle bowl that 
    will make you not want to come up for air until you finish all of it.
    Mazesoba is a newcomer to the ramen game (like me), created in 2008 in Nagoya.
    Kokoro is a chain of mazesoba shops that you can find all over Tokyo.

    A local favorite, this shop gets very busy around lunch time. If you can endure the wait
    you will be rewarded with a simmering bowl of thick, oily, fishy tasting broth with slices
    of thick pork alongside a plate of noodles. On top of the noodles is some extra crispy fried
    chicken. This tsukemen will leave you feeling full, heavy and happy.

    Inside the famous Golden Gai bar district, Ramen Nagi is open 24 hours, which means this
    is the perfect place for a late night bowl of noodles. The fish broth Shoyu ramen
    is very pungent. The pink pork, small fish, nori and green onion and completed by a dab of
    chili sauce to give this ramen a kick. Slurp the fishy broth and crack open the egg to 
    see the lava of yolk ooze out.

    This unassuming shop serves up some delicious Hakata ramen at a very cheap price of ¥650.
    Open until 3AM and cash-only, you won't find gaijin tourists here or culinary experts, 
    just ordinary people who love ramen.
    The tonkatsu (pork bone) broth is not too thick or heavy, featuring garlic and a hefty amount of green onion on top.
    Order a plate of extra fried pork and a large bottle of beer to feel like real salaryman.

    If you visit Sendai, eating at this ramen shop is a must. The queue is always long, 
    an indicator of how bomb the ramen here is.
    Once inside, you need to place your order quickly or else face the rath of the 
    ramen master who does not put up with chatting or anything else besides eating 
    your bowl as fast as you can. The portions are absoluelty gigantic, twice as big
    as a normal bowl. Just ask for たくさん (takusan) when asked about how much vegetables
    and garlic you want and you will receive a bowl piled higher than the nearby mountains.
