    Located in the heart of Shibuya, if you come here past midnight you might encounter
    some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shibuyameltdown">Shibuya Metldown</a>.
    The dark broth of this ramen is very salty and very tasty.
    On top of the noodles is grilled pork, crispy nori and a yolky egg. 
    The inside of the shop is tiny, only able to seat 8 at a time, and usually filled with 
    salary men and hip hop music. Experience the nightlife of Shibuya and ackowledge 
    that you cannot knock Jay Z's hustle.

    One of the oldest ramen shops in Tokyo, this shop opened in 1952 and has since remained
    somewhat of a relic amongst the bustling metropolis nearby. Many of the customers
    have been coming here for decades and some of the staff appear to have
    been around even longer. Saddle up for some old school Tokyo-style Shoyu
    ramen with chewy house-made noodles and dried onions. Order 'moyashi' if
    you want your bowl to be piled with bean sprouts. Wontonmen is also available.
    Nothing fake or touristy here, just old school Japanese soul food. Beloved and
    legendary shop.

    If you are in search of oily, fatty jiro ramen that will make your gut burst, look no further.
    Starting at ¥700, the ramen bowls here are topped with thick cuts of pork,
    a boiled egg, a generous plop of garlic and a massive heap of 
    bean sprouts. In my experience, there is often a queue that is a 20 to 30 minute wait.
    When they will ask you your preference of vegetables and garlic, simply
    respond with ましお願いします (mashi onegaishimasu) and the ramen master will hook you up
    with the largest bowl of ramen you have ever seen.

    My #1 goto ramen shop. Very good Hakata ramen, one of the best and most authentic I have
    tried in Tokyo. Located near Futako Tamagawa Station. 
    The shop is a little bit dirty, and inside there are only 8 seats, so sometimes you might
    have to wait in a short line. The broth is made from proper pork bones. 
    On multiple occasions I have seen an employee dumping bags of pork bones
    into the broth vat in the back of the shop, so you know it's legit. I recommend ordering a half
    bowl of rice after you finish your noodles, then putting the rice with
    the all you can eat takana (Japanese giant red mustard) into the remaining 
    broth and enjoy.

    While technically not ramen, I could not exclude this mazesoba shop from the list.
    A tapestry of seaweed flakes, green onions, chives, minced garlic, 
    nori (dried seaweed), chashu (pork), spicy minced pork, raw egg yolk, 
    and a soft-boiled egg mixed together to create a brothless noodle bowl that 
    creates a delicious noodle mix (maze means to mix).
    Mazesoba is a newcomer to the ramen game (like me), created in 2008 in Nagoya.
    Kokoro is a chain of mazesoba shops that you can find all over Tokyo, the head shop
    is in Akihabara.

    Literally called mammoth ramen, this ramen was inspired by Jiro ramen.
    It is only open during lunch time from 11AM - 3PM and there is usually a line.
    The combination of pork and seafood is exquisite. When your bowl is delivered the
    bonito flakes are still dancing on top of the thick cuts of pork. For only
    ¥800, the basic bowl is still a massive portion size. You can choose regular or spicy.
    I also recommend to ask for extra garlic (nin niku).

    you will be rewarded with a simmering bowl of thick, oily, fishy tasting broth with slices

    chicken. This tsukemen will leave you feeling full, heavy and happy.

    Open until 3AM and cash-only, you won't find gaijin tourists here or culinary experts, 
    just ordinary people who love ramen.
    The tonkotsu (pork bone) broth is not too thick or heavy, and features garlic and a hefty amount of green onion on top.
    Taste and see the small white bubbles in nthe broth to know this tokotsu is legit.
    Order a plate of extra fried pork and a large bottle of beer to feel like real salaryman.

    Kitakata has the most ramen shops per capita in Japan, so you know I 
    had to go there. Alongside Sapporo ramen
    and Hakata ramen, Kitakata ramen is one of Japan's three major ramen noodle dynasties. 
    Kitakata ramen is characterized by its unique noodles, known as Hirauchi Jukusei Taka Suimen, 
    which translates as “Matured Flat Noodles with Lots of Water,” they are about four millimeters wide, 
    flat and curled. Because they’ve been matured for a long period of time, they’re firm, filling, 
    and have a unique texture when chewed. The line during lunch was about 1.5 hours, but it was worth it
    to try this legendary ramen shop.

    A unique style found in the northern most part of Honshu, this shops serves up

    from Sapporo to the north, the legend goes that several years after it initially 
    opening in the 1970s, some high schoolers would add ketchup and mayonnaise to make
    their ramen more filling. This prompted the shop to create a miso, curry and milk
    combination. The soup is surprisingly mild. The thick, curly egg-yellow noodles, made 
    locally, provide a more chewy texture. Topped with chashu, bean sprouts, bamboo
    shoots and seweed, this  is extremely delicious and satisfying.
