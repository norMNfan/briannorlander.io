<!-- Intro -->
<section class="text">
	<p>During late October I took a long weekend trip to Beijing with two of my Swedish friends from HKUST, Viktor and Rebecca. The weather was mild during the day and got very chilly at night. In the mountains surrounding Beijing the leaves were changing color and it was clear that winter was coming.</p>

<!-- Beijing -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>Beijing</h2>
	<p>Formerly known as Peking, Beijing is the capital of China as well as the third most populous city in the world. Beijing is the center of the political, cultural, and economic activity of the largest country on earth. It's subway system is the busiest and second largest in the world.</p>
	<p>Beijing is very symmetrical with gridded streets. The Forbidden Palace is in the center of the city. The subway lines and highways make several rings around the city.</p>
	<p>To enter China as a foreigner you need to have a visa. Americans are able to get a 10-year multiple entry visa, which is what I got in Hong Kong. My Swedish friends were only able to get 6 month or 1 year visas.</p>

<!-- Summer Palace -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>Summer Palace</h2>
    <p>The Summer Palace is a place that Chinese emperors could relax and enjoy nature. It has a large pond surrounded with trees, temples and pathways.</p>
	<p>The air quality was very bad during most of our trip. It was hard to see very far away and I noticed that my breathing was more difficult. Many people wore masks.</p>

	<h2>The Great Wall</h2>
	<p>We visited a section of the Great Wall called Mutianyu. Part of this section was rebuilt in the 1980s, along with a cable car to get to the top. After a 1 hour hike along the wall we came to an original section of the wall that was over 2000 years old.</p>
