<!-- Intro -->
<section class="text">
	<p>After my exchange semester ended at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ended I took a 6 day trip to Cambodia. A year before this trip I would never imagined traveling to Cambodia, but here I was exploring Angkor Wat and temples that reminded me of Star Wars or Indiana Jones.</p>

<!-- Phnom Penh -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>Phnom Penh</h2>
	<p>The long time capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, is by far the largest city in the country and is the most significant economically, politically and culturally. Situated on the banks of the Tonl√© Sap and Mekong rivers, the Phnom Penh metropolitan area has a population of over 1.5 million.</p>

<!-- Killing Fields + Prison -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>The Killing Fields and Tuol Sleng Prison</h2>
	<p>
        Between 1975 and 1979 almost 2 million people died during the Cambodian Genocide. After winning the Cambodian Civil War Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge took total control of the country. They aimed to dramatically transform society by forcibly moving people living in cities to rural settlements and eliminating technology and intellectuals in order to return to "year zero". This is a very important and heavy topic that needs more recognition. For more information read <a href="http://endgenocide.org/learn/past-genocides/the-cambodian-genocide/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today Cambodia is far behind its neighboring countries in many quality of life indexes. This is a lasting legacy of the Cambodian Genocide, an event that has caused trauma and many other problem in the country that are still evident today.
    </p>
	<p>
        I first visited the killing fields, a mass unmarked grave where many thousands of Cambodians were killed indiscriminately.

    <p>Halfway through the last day in Phnom Penh I started to feel very sick. The combination of food poisoning, heat, sun and exhaustion from walking around caught up to me. The night bus from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap left the station at 11:30PM and arrived the next morning at 6AM. I will leave out the details but the experience was less than comfortable.</p>

<!-- Siem Reap -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>Siem Reap</h2>
	<p>One of the largest cities in Cambodia and a popular tourist destination, Siem Reap is just a tuk tuk ride away from Angkor Wat and many other ancient temples.</p>
	<p>For each tuk tuk ride the price is individually negotiated depending on distance, busyness and supply of other drivers nearby. Nearly every time you step outside multiple tuk tuk drivers will call out to you asking if you need a ride.</p>
