<!-- Intro -->
<section class="text">
	<p>During the first month of my exchange to Hong Kong I went to Shenzhen and Guangzhou. I went to Shenzhen with a large group of exchange students and a couple Hong Kongers and stayed one night. I then went to Guangzhou alone to take advantage of my 10 year visa.</p>

<!-- Shenzhen -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>Shenzhen</h2>
	<p>A major city in the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, Shenzhen was first designed to be a special economic zone. In 1980 the area that is now Shenzhen was a quiet fishing village. In the 1990s and 2000s Shenzhen was one of the fastest growing cities in the world, which now boasts one of the most impressive skylines in the world, a stock exchange, and a population of 20 million immigrants who are mostly from mainland China.</p>

        We began exploring the city. Shenzhen is so new it doesn't have any history before 30 or 40 years ago. Being a modern city in China, it has many enormous skyscrapers, some futuristic arcades, and the worlds biggest electronic market.

<!-- Guangzhou -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>Guangzhou</h2>
	<p>
        The heart of the Pearl River Delta, Guangzhou has been the terminus city of the silk road for many years and today is one of China's largest ports. Formerly known an Canton, it was the only Chinese port open to foreign trade after the silk road became obsolete.
    </p>
	<p>
        Leaving Shenzhen, the railway station had no English. I had to use a combination of Baidu (a Chinese version of Google), trying to ask for help and intuition to successfully buy a train ticket to Guangzhou. Once I bought the ticket that I thought was right, I had no idea if the train I boarded was going to Guangzhou or some far away province in China. I crossed my fingers and boarded the train.
    </p>
        Traveling to China is not like any other country. I was surprised by how little English people spoke here. Arriving in Guangzhou late at night definitely felt somewhat unnerving. There were so many policemen everywhere, the security was so strict and many of the streets felt empty. However, arriving in any foreign city at night when you are tired can feel this way.

	<h2>China: Out with the old and in with the new</h2>
	<p>After exploring the spectacular downtown I stumbled something breathtaking. An old village was being completely demolished in order to be replaced by massive apartments. In this village there was at least 10 meters of rubble everywhere and people were still living there!</p>

        This was the end of my travels in China... for a month. In October I went to Beijing. Southern China has a very different feel than northern China. The language, food and people are very different. China is such a massive country it is a huge challenge to understand the country in just one lifetime.

        I took the train back to Hong Kong.
