<!-- Intro -->
<section class="text">
	<p>During the first month of my exchange to Hong Kong I went to Shenzhen and Guangzhou. In Shenzhen a large group of exchange students and a couple Hong Kongers went together and stayed one night. I then went to Guangzhou alone to take advantage of my 10 year visa.</p>

<!-- Shenzhen -->
<section class="text">
	<h2>Shenzhen</h2>
	<p>A major city in the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, Shenzhen was first designed to be a special economic zone. In 1980 the area that is now Shenzhen was a quiet fishing village. In the 1990s and 2000s Shenzhen was one of the fastest growing cities in the world, which now boasts one of the most impressive skylines in the world, a stock exchange, and a population of 20 million immigrants who are mostly from mainland China.</p>

	<h2>Guangzhou</h2>
	<p>The heart of the Pearl River Delta, Guangzhou has been the terminus city of the silk road for many years and today is one of China's largest ports. Formerly known an Canton, after the silk road became obsolete, Canton was the only Chinese port open to foreign trade.</p>
	<p>Leaving Shenzhen, the railway station had no English. I had to use a combination of Baidu (a Chinese version of Google), trying to ask for help and intuition to successfully buy a train ticket to Guangzhou.</p>

	<h2>China: Out with the old and in with the new</h2>
	<p>After exploring the spectacular downtown I stumbled something breathtaking. An old village was being completely demolished in order to be replaced by massive apartments. In this village there was at least 10 meters of rubble everywhere and people were still living there!</p>
