<!-- Intro -->
<section class="text">
	<p>While on exchange I took a day trip to Macau from Hong Kong with two of my friends from school, Harrison and Tristan. We boarded the ferry from Hong Kong bright and early on Saturday morning and got back very late that same night. We walked over 20km in one day and experienced much of what Macau had to offer.

    <h2>Macau</h2>
    <p>Macau sits at the mouth of the Pearl River delta in the Guangdong region of Southern China, the most populated continuous metropolitan area in the world. Formerly a colony of Portugal, Ming China leased the territory as a trading post in 1557 to keep foreigners at an arms distance away from mainland China. Macau remained under Portuguese control until 1999 when it was returned to China. Macau is currently a special administrative region which expires in 2049.</p>

    <h2>Portuguese Influence</h2>
    <p>Macau was previously held by Portugal until 1999. In Macau this is apparent in much of the architecture and restaurants. Below are a few of the buildings and streets from the colonial period.</p>
    <p>Let's take a closer look.</p>

    <h2>Getting lost</h2>
    <p>After we left the fort we decided to simply wander through Macau in search of good food and to explore. We saw a lot of random buildings and markets where mainly locals were.</p>
