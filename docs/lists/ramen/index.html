    <section class="text">
    <p>
        "Let's go to Ichiran, it's the best ramen in Japan!" I heard on a crowded train as a smirk started to form across my face. I was on my way home coming back from crushing a bowl of Moyashi-men from Kiraku-ya, a legendary ramen shop in Shibuya.

        I will show you some of the best places I cherry picked from my experiences in Tokyo, my local area, and across Japan. I only added shops that will guarantee you a delicious ramen experience.

    <h2>Bowls to Smash in Tokyo</h2>
    <p>
        If you are coming to Japan, chances are you will be coming to Tokyo. Although known for shopping and nightlife, many places such as Shibuya and Shinjuku have incredible ramen shops hidden amongst the bustling metropolis if you know where to look.

The dark broth of this ramen is very salty and very tasty.
On top of the noodles is grilled pork, crispy nori and a yolky egg. 
The inside of the shop is tiny, only able to seat 8 at a time, and usually filled with 
salary men and hip hop music. Experience the nightlife of Shibuya and acknowledge 
that you cannot knock Jay Z's hustle.

            <p>One of the oldest ramen shops in Tokyo, this shop opened in 1952 and has since remained
somewhat of a relic amongst the bustling metropolis nearby. Many of the customers
have been coming here for decades and some of the staff appear to have
been around even longer. Saddle up for some old school Tokyo-style Shoyu
ramen with chewy house-made noodles and dried onions. Order 'moyashi' if
you want your bowl to be piled with bean sprouts. Wontonmen is also available.
Nothing fake or touristy here, just old school Japanese soul food. Beloved and
legendary shop.

An overall great shop. English is also available.

    <h2>Local Favorites</h2>
    <p>
        While in Japan, I lived near <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mqnBPYYG1F9dPvJWA">Mizonokuchi Station</a> and explored many ramen shops nearby in my local area.
    </p>
    <p>
        You won't find any of these shops on any 'Top 10' lists. Nope, these shops are known by locals and frequented by salary men and students alike. They are not English friendly and won't have a fancy interior. Just cheap, delicious, classic ramen experiences.

            <p>My #1 go-to ramen shop. Very good Hakata ramen, one of the best and most authentic I have
tried in Tokyo. Located near Futako Tamagawa Station. 
The shop is a little dirty, and inside there are only 8 seats, so sometimes you might
have to wait in a short line. The broth is made from proper pork bones. 
On multiple occasions I have seen an employee dumping bags of pork bones
into the broth vat in the back of the shop, so you know it's legit. I recommend ordering a half
bowl of rice after you finish your noodles, then putting the rice with
the all you can eat takana (Japanese giant red mustard) into the remaining 
broth and enjoy.

            <p>While technically not ramen, I could not exclude this mazesoba shop from the list.
A tapestry of seaweed flakes, green onions, chives, minced garlic, 
nori (dried seaweed), chashu (pork), spicy minced pork, raw egg yolk, 
and a soft-boiled egg mixed together to create a brothless noodle bowl that 
creates a delicious noodle mix (maze means to mix).
Mazesoba is a newcomer to the ramen game (like me), created in 2008 in Nagoya.
Kokoro is a chain of mazesoba shops that you can find all over Tokyo, the head shop
is in Akihabara.

            <p>Literally called mammoth ramen, this ramen was inspired by Jiro ramen.
It is only open during lunchtime from 11AM - 3PM and there is usually a line.
The combination of pork and seafood is exquisite. When your bowl is delivered the
bonito flakes are still dancing on top of the thick cuts of pork. For only
¥800, the basic bowl is still a massive portion size. You can choose regular or spicy.
I also recommend asking for extra garlic (nin niku).

this is the goto place in the area for niboshi ramen.

you will be rewarded with a simmering bowl of thick, oily, fishy tasting broth with slices

chicken. This tsukemen will leave you feeling full, heavy and happy.

            <h5>長浜ラーメン 博多っ子 | <a target="_blank" href="https://google.com/maps?q=Nagahama ramen Hakatakko">Map</a></h5>
            <p>This unassuming shop serves up some delicious Hakata ramen at the very cheap price of ¥650.
Open until 3AM and cash-only, you won't find gaijin tourists here or culinary experts, 
just ordinary people who love ramen.
The tonkotsu (pork bone) broth is not too thick or heavy, and features garlic and a hefty amount of green onion on top.
Taste and see the small white bubbles in in the broth to know this tonkotsu is legit.
Order a plate of extra fried pork and a large bottle of beer to feel like real salary man.

            <p>This Yokohama Iekei style ramen is very thick, oily and fatty. Yokohama
Iekei style ramen is one of the fastest growing styles of ramen in Japan 
and you can find it all over Kanagawa. In fact, Yokohama style ramen was the first
bowl of ramen I had in Japan, even though at the time I was unaware. For ¥900
you can order the chashu pork bowl. Extra noodles are free. This shop is
also famous for its homemade gyoza, only costing ¥300 and is very delicious.
Overall a great spot for Yokohama ramen.

    <h2>Outside of Tokyo</h2>
    <p>
        While in Japan, I was able to explore many areas outside of Tokyo. Each time I went to a new city or region, my first priority was tasting the local variety of ramen. Whether it was Hokkaido, Kyushu, or anywhere in between, I tried many shops all over Japan. Below I compiled a list of my favorites.

            <p>Go here if you are looking for authentic Kitakata ramen. They city of
Kitakata has the most ramen shops per capita in Japan, so you know I 
had to go there. Alongside Sapporo ramen
and Hakata ramen, Kitakata ramen is one of Japan's three major ramen noodle dynasties. 
Kitakata ramen is characterized by its unique noodles, known as Hirauchi Jukusei Taka Suimen, 
which translates as “Matured Flat Noodles with Lots of Water,” they are about four millimeters wide, 
flat and curled. Because they’ve been matured for a long period of time, they’re firm, filling, 
and have a unique texture when chewed. The line during lunch was about 1.5 hours, but it was worth it
to try this legendary ramen shop.

            <p>Located in Ichijoji, Kyoto's storied ramen district, this shop is famous for
its very thick broth, that is closer to gravy than broth. There is always
a line at this shop. Before I smashed a bowl of chicken broth ramen, I was told
by one of the employees that I should come back in 2 hours to get in a line of
about 10 other customers. The ramen here is extremely tasty and extremely thick,
creating a unique ramen experience in Kyoto. Order a side of rice, egg, and minced meat
for an unforgettable experience.

            <p>This shop is the de facto O.G. Okinawa Soba shop in Naha. With a very basic interior, 
the inside of the shop feels a bit like a cafeteria. Straight noodles
are topped with abundant amounts of Okinawa Agu pig. The broth is light
and even slightly sweet. You can add extra mugwort (よもぎ) to your soba,
but beware because it is quite bitter. Okinawa Soba is a must try if you visit Okinawa.

            <p>A unique style found in the northern most part of Honshu, this shops serves up
hot bowls of curry milk butter ramen, Aomori's soul food. Getting its origins 
from Sapporo to the north, the legend goes that several years after it initially 
opening in the 1970s, some high schoolers would add ketchup and mayonnaise to make
their ramen more filling. This prompted the shop to create a miso, curry and milk
combination. The soup is surprisingly mild. The thick, curly egg-yellow noodles, made 
locally, provide a more chewier texture. Topped with chashu, bean sprouts, bamboo
shoots and seaweed, this  is extremely delicious and satisfying.
