<p>I wrote an article explaining what primitive types and wrapper objects are in Java. I explained the concepts of autoboxing and unboxing the steps the compiler does to accomplish these conversions. Autoboxing and unboxing can be detrimental to the performance of your program if abused inside a critical inner loop. Lastly I give a recommendation whether to use primitive types of wrapper objects depending on the situation.</p>
