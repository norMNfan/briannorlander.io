<p>I created a personal website using Jekyll, Gulp, SCSS and many other libraries and tools that is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/norMNfan/briannorlander.io">Github pages</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to not only showcase my travels, projects and other various things, but also to improve my web development skills, learn new technologies and have some fun with it.</p>
