<p>
	Around May 2018 I created a personal website using Jekyll, Gulp, SCSS and many other libraries and tools. My website serves static pages hosted on <a href="https://github.com/norMNfan/briannorlander.io">Github pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of creating this website to highlight my travels, projects, and post some of my writings. In the process I learned some cool technologies and tools which have helped me improve my web development skills.
