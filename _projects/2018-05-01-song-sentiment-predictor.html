<p>This was a partner project for my final project for an artificial intelligence class (CSCI 4511W) at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to predictor the sentiment of a song. There were 7 categories: happy, anger, funny, hurt, calm, romantic, and inspirational. Our program created used the Naive Bayes and Support Vector Model algorithms to create a classifier to predict the sentiment of songs based only on their lyrics. The ground truth was based on 400+ songs. Once the classifiers were created we built an interactive web page where a user could enter a song name and the predicted sentiment would display.</p>
